%%%%%%%%%  Question 1
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item \textbf{Writing Functions and Loops.} Create a function called \texttt{f1} 
  in \texttt{R}, in as few lines as possible that represents the  following function.
    \[f_1(x) = \ln\left(\sqrt{x*10^3}\right)\]
    Compare the runtime of your function to the one below using a loop that saves 
    the runtime of each function over 1000 iterations. Summarize and compare the results.
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
> f2 <- function(x){
+   a<- x*10^3
+   b<- sqrt(a)
+   c<- log(b)
+   return(c)
+ }
> f2(1)
\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}
[1] 3.453878
\end{Soutput}
\end{Schunk}
You can track the runtime of code using the following \texttt{R} code.
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
> start_time <- Sys.time()
> #do things you want to time here
> end_time <- Sys.time()
> runtime <-end_time - start_time
\end{Sinput}
\end{Schunk}
You might want to report this runtime in your .pdf document, but you'll find that the 
runtime changes each time you compile your document. You can pass variable values in \texttt{R}
to the document using the \texttt{Sexpr} command. For example, the runtime of the comment above
is 0.001 seconds.

\textbf{Solution:}
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
> #creating f1 and f2 that perform the same function
> f1 <- function(x){ #my more efficient code
+   return(log(sqrt(x*10^3))) #originally put ln as a function here whoops
+   }
> f2 <- function(x){ #less efficient code
+   a<- x*10^3
+   b<- sqrt(a)
+   c<- log(b)
+   return(c)
+ }
> #test
> #start_time2 <- Sys.time()
> #f2(1)
> #end_time2 <- Sys.time()
> #runtime2 <- end_time1 - start_time2
> #runtime2
> 
> #runtime for f1
> r1 <- function(n){
+ start_time1 <- Sys.time() #start time
+ f1(1) #call efficient function
+ end_time1 <- Sys.time() #end time
+ runtime1 <-end_time1 - start_time1 #runtime
+ return(runtime1)
+ }
> #runtime for f2
> r2 <- function(n){
+ start_time2 <- Sys.time() #start time
+ f2(1) #call less efficient function
+ end_time2 <- Sys.time() #end time
+ runtime2 <-end_time2 - start_time2 #runtime
+ return(runtime2)
+ }
> #initialize 
> t1 = 0
> t2 = 0
> #1000 iterations of runtime for both functions
> for (number in 1:1000){ 
+   t1 = t1 + r1(1)
+   t2 = t2 + r2(1)
+ }
> #compare average difference of runtimes
> t1 = t1/1000
> t2 = t2/1000
> #output  
> t1
\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}
Time difference of 7.054329e-06 secs
\end{Soutput}
\begin{Sinput}
> t2
\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}
Time difference of 7.52902e-06 secs
\end{Soutput}
\end{Schunk}

The runtime for function 2 is greater than the runtime for function 1 because function 2 is creating variables which takes more runtime than simply using 1 variable. My program reported about a $3e^-06$ difference in runtimes as the average difference between the two functions.

%%%%%%%%%  Question 2
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  \item \textbf{Conditional Statements and Loops.} Assess which is faster.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Generate 1000 random integers between 1 and 1000 with replacement with
    the following \texttt{R} code.
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
> random.ints<-sample(x=1:1000,size=1000,replace=TRUE)
\end{Sinput}
\end{Schunk}
    Then, using a loop, create a vector named \texttt{random.type} that is ``odd"
    when the corresponding value in \texttt{random.ints} is odd and ``even" otherwise.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Add elements to the vector called \texttt{random.type} as they
      are decided; e.g., for an iteration where the value is odd we add
      an element using \texttt{random.type<-c(random.type,"odd")}.
      \item Create an empty vector of size 1000 (with \texttt{NA} entries) to 
      start and place elements into the vector; e.g., for iteration $i$
      where the value is odd we place the element using \texttt{random.type[i]}.
    \end{enumerate}
    Which is faster?
\end{enumerate}

\textbf{Solution:}
Part 2 is faster. Placing elements into a vector is faster than creating them and then placing them in the vector.
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
> #part i - add elements to a vector as they are decided
> random.ints1 <-sample(x=1:1000,size=1000,replace=TRUE)
> start_timei <- Sys.time() #time the process
> random.type1 <- c()
> for (i in 1:1000){
+   if (random.ints1[i]%%2 != 0) { #iterate through each value
+     random.type1<- c(random.type1,"odd")
+   } else {
+     random.type1<- c(random.type1,"even")
+   }
+ }
> end_timei <- Sys.time()
> runtimei <-end_timei - start_timei
> #part ii - create a vector and then place elements into vector
> #random.ints<-sample(x=1:1000,size=1000,replace=TRUE)
> start_timeii <- Sys.time() #time the process
> random.type = rep(NA, 1000)
> for (i in 1:1000){
+   if (random.ints1[1]%%2 != 0){
+     vec <- c(random.type[i],"odd")
+   } else {
+     vec <- c(random.type[i], "even")
+   }
+ }
> end_timeii <- Sys.time()
> runtimeii <-end_timeii - start_timeii
> #output and compare the start time and end time
> print(runtimei)
\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}
Time difference of 0.01355505 secs
\end{Soutput}
\begin{Sinput}
> print(runtimeii)
\end{Sinput}
\begin{Soutput}

  \item \textbf{Conditional Statements and Loops} Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is 
  generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 
  10 terms will be 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89. Find the sum of the even terms in the 
  Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed one million.

\textbf{Solution:}  
\begin{Schunk}

%%%%%%%%%  Question 4
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%  
  \item  \textbf{Conditional Statements and Loops} A palindromic number reads the same 
  both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 
  $9009 = 91 \times 99$. Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
  
  You can get the reverse of a number using the ``stringr" package for \texttt{R}
  (practice Sweave by putting by the citation here:
  \cite{R}) as follows.

As is seen in the figure, Beck Depression Scores seem to be right skewed in terms of severity. It seems like the most people are minimally depressed (200+), while around 80 people are severely depressed, the smallest category. The median depression score is 17 and the mean is 17.37, meaning that the data doesn't seem to be too skewed. The maximum depression score is 54 and the minimum depression score is 0.

The boxplot indicates to us that half of the depression scores in the sample are between 10 and 23, meaning that half of the sample is between mnimally and moderately depressed. 75 percent of the scores in the sample are 23 or lower, meaning that most people are moderately depressed or less depressed.While the maximum depression score in this sample is 54, that score along with the score above 40 are both outliers, which may be causing the right skew and explain why the range of scores for severe depression is so large. When looking at the histogram below, we see that most depression scores are concentrated in the range of minimally depressed, with the first spike being the largest by 0.00. We see a relatively taller bar at the right end of the histogram compared to the two bars to the left of it which further illustrates that there are two outliers in the data under the severely depressed category.

  %%%%%%%%%  Question 6
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
    \item \textbf{(Working with Data)} Hepatitis C is a disease 
    that affects the liver. The virus that causes hepatitis C 
    is spread through blood or bodily fluids of an infected person. 
    The virus is often difficult to diagnose because there are few unique 
    symptoms. Those infected, however, sometimes experience jaundice -- a 
    condition that causes yellowing of the skin or eyes, as the liver 
    is infected.

    \cite{Bracht16} consider the human microfibrillar-associated protein 4,
    or MFAP4, and its role in disease-related tissue. Stage 0--no fibrosis; 
    Stage 1--enlarged, fibrotic portal tracts; Stage 2--periportal fibrosis 
    or portal-portal septa, but intact architecture; Stage 3--fibrosis with
    architectural distortion, but no obvious cirrhosis; and Stage 4--probable
    or definite cirrhosis.

    Previously, it has been shown that MFAP4 is a biomarker candidate for hepatic
    fibrosis and cirrhosis in hepatitis C patients. The analysis of \cite{Bracht16}
    aimed to consider the ability of MFAP4 to differentiate between stages of the 
    disease -- fibrosis stages (0-2) and cirrhosis (3-4) based on the Scheuer 
    scoring system.
    
    Below, I load the data and calculate the age of patients using the ``lubridate"
    package for \texttt{R} \citep{lubridate}.

  \item Recreate Table 1 in \href{the paper}{https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4932744/}. 
  Add a row to this table labeled ``Median age IQR." I've provided the LaTeX code for the
  table and made the first entry so you can see how it works.

For the table above, I created 5 filtered dataframes to in order to find values that were specific to each stage of Fibrosis (0-4). I used these filtered dataframes to create 10 graphs so that researchers could view whether or not there was any correlation between HCV Genotype and Fibrosis Stage, as well as Gender and Fibrosis Stage. When looking at the graphs for gender filtered by Fibrosis Stage, we see that there is little variation between gender until we're viewing the data for Fibrosis Stage 4 patients, where there are noticeably fewer females than males. There seems to be little difference between males and females in the early stages of fibrosis. When looking at the graphs that illustrate the relationship between HCV Genotypes and Fibrosis Stages, HCV Genotype 1 is noticeably more present in all stages of Fibrosis than any other HCV Genotype. HCV Genotype NA and 3 were also all present, indicating a relationship with a smaller magnitude between these genotypes and Fibrosis Stages, while there seems to be little to no correlation between HCV Genotype Other and Fibrosis, as well as HCV Genotype 4 and Fibrosis. There seems to be little difference in these patterns when comparing across all stages of Fibrosis.
